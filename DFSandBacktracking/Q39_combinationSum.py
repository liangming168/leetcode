"""
Q39 Combination Sum

Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]

method dfs backtracking
use remainder to keep next target, remainder[0]=target, remainder = remainder - candidates[j]
iterate candidates[j], push candidates[j] to curr, update remainder go next dfs
after this level done, pop candidates[j]

if remainder == 0, find the resuslts, attach curr to res
else if remainder <0 , no result, resturn None

note: attach curr[:] to res, shallow copy
directly update remainder in dfs(*,*,*ï¼Œremainder-candidates[j]), to avoid conflict in different copy depth
this problem can use one number duplicate, so don't increase j for next dfs

time: O((n+k)!), n is size of candidates and k is the max duplitaction for each num,
space: O(n+k), the depth of the recursion
